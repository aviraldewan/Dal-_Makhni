Soak both the whole urad dal and rajma overnight in enough water for 8 to 9 hours or overnight. Later drain them well.
Rinse both the lentils a couple of times in water.
Drain again and then add them in a 3 litre pressure cooker. Add water and stir well.
Pressure cook for 18 to 20 whistles on a high flame, till both the urad dal and rajma have cooked thoroughly and softened. If they are not cooked, then add about 1/2 cup water again and pressure cook for 4 to 5 whistles more.
The urad dal should melt in the mouth and should not give any bite or resistance when eaten. You can also just mash the urad dal with a spoon or with your fingers to check the doneness. The same rule applies for rajma too. Keep the cooked beans aside.
In a blender or mixer jar, take chopped tomatoes and blend to a smooth puree. Set aside.
You can also add ready 1 cup tomato puree instead of blending the tomatoes. No need to blanch the tomatoes while pureeing.
